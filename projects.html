                        <p class="p-project">My project 'Homebanking Application' is a standout example of my ability to develop robust and functional web applications. I used a variety of cutting-edge technologies, including Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Postman, Vue.js, HTML, CSS, Gradle, and IntelliJ to create this simulation of a complete banking application.
                            <br>
                            This application offers users the ability to register, log in, manage bank accounts, make transfers to both their own and third-party accounts, request credit and debit cards, and apply for loans. It is a versatile and secure tool that replicates the experience of using a real banking application.
                            <br>
                            I am proud of this project as it showcases my expertise in high-quality web application development with a focus on security and usability. Serving as a testament to my commitment to software development excellence, 'Homebanking Application' is a valuable component of my portfolio that demonstrates my technical and creative skills in action.</p>

                    <div class="description-projet-p">
                        <p class="p-project">My project 'Amazing Events' is an innovative web platform that provides detailed information about events, both upcoming and past. Users can explore upcoming events, learn about their location, time, maximum capacity, and, in the case of past events, the attendance percentage. What makes 'Amazing Events' exceptional is its ability to allow users to filter events effectively.
                            <br>
                            The platform features two powerful filters that can be used simultaneously, enabling users to fine-tune their searches in a cross-cutting manner. The first filter consists of event categories that can be checked or unchecked based on user preferences. The second filter allows for text-based searches, making it easy to find specific events. The combination of both filters ensures that users find exactly what they are looking for.
                            <br>
                            To make this functionality possible, JavaScript has been used, adding a layer of interactivity and dynamism to the user experience. 'Amazing Events' not only provides information about events but also enhances the way users interact with it.
                            <br>
                            This project showcases my ability to create interactive and functional web applications that effectively cater to user needs. 'Amazing Events' is a valuable addition to my portfolio and demonstrates my capability to implement innovative web solutions.</p>

Users can explore a wide range of available courses, get in touch with our sales team for additional information, and learn more about the academy and its directors.
                            <br>
                            Although the project is not yet fully completed due to external factors beyond web development, 'CEDI' represents a comprehensive approach to creating an online educational platform. From the design and development of the front-end, I have considered all possible screens and resolutions from which users may access the campus. This ensures a smooth and engaging user experience, regardless of the device they use.
                            <br>
                            Despite the challenges, 'CEDI' demonstrates my commitment to excellence in web design and the creation of quality virtual learning environments.

This platform stands out for its ability to collect personal data and specific player characteristics through a detailed registration form.
                            <br>
                            The primary functionality of 'Mighty Ducks Hockey League' is the ease with which players can register to participate in the league. The registration form gathers essential information, allowing league administrators to have a complete view of the participants. This not only simplifies league management but also enhances the player experience by providing a straightforward and efficient registration process.
